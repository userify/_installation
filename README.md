= Userify Installation


This repo shows what happens when Userify is first installed and what a working
Userify installation looks like.


Immediately after installation, this will be displayed on screen:


       
                             _--_
                            (    \
                         --/      )
                    .-- /   \      \
                  ./   \            ) _  __
                 /_   _ ___  ___ _ __(_)/ _|_   _
                 | | | / __|/ _ \ '__| | |_  | | |
                 | |_| \__ \  __/ |  | |  _| |_| |
                  \__,_|___/\___|_|  |_|_|  \__, |
                                            |___/  tm
    
                    Installing Userify now..                     
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    Tip: to understand how the shim works, read the source at
    https://github.com/userify/shim/
    
    Creating Userify directory (/opt/userify/)
    Creating uninstall script (/opt/userify/uninstall.sh)
    Creating API login config (/opt/userify/creds.py)
    Creating shim (/opt/userify/shim.{sh,py})
    Removing exit 0 from rc.local (if there)
    Checking Shim Startup
    Adding Linux Startup Script to /etc/rc.local
    Setting Permissions
    Launching shim.sh
    
    Finished. Userify shim has been completely installed.
    /opt/userify/uninstall.sh as root to uninstall.
    debug=1 is enabled in /opt/userify/userify_config.py for extra verbosity.
    Please review shim output in /var/log/userify-shim.log
    
    cat /var/log/userify-shim.log
    
    Thanks for using Userify!

The following files will be created and any user accounts specified in
the Userify console will be instantly created, SSH keys created, and sudo
rights granted (if applicable).


+    [opt/userify/userify_config.py](opt/userify/userify_config.py)
+    [opt/userify/creds.py](opt/userify/creds.py)
+    [opt/userify/shim.sh](opt/userify/shim.sh)
+    [var/log/userify_shim.log](var/log/userify_shim.log)
+    [uninstall.sh](uninstall.sh)


Depending on the type of system, /opt/userify/shim.sh will be set up to
execute on boot using the least invasive way possible (many systems
will just get a line appended  /etc/rc.local: /opt/userify/shim.sh &).


That's all there is to it! More info available at the Userify shim
